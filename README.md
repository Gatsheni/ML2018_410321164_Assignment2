In this assingment. A handwritten digit recognizer is implemented using a Support Vector Machine(SVM).
The SVM is already a part of the sklearn module so importing it from sklearn is required. An alternitive would be to implement the SVM from scratch. The trainning dataset is also avaible in the sklearn module and alternitive would be manually taking pictures of then importing them.
